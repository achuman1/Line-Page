# Line-Page
This code is for a page that involves a registration and login page that crosschecks the username and password entered by the user. 
It then flows into a line of menu's that a user can choose from that keeps branching out. 
This code keeps running (in a loop) until the user terminates it and they can go back to the start at any point of time.
It is still a work in progress as I have encountered a few issues with the login and registration part and am yet to find a solution to this problem and 
finish the rest of the code.
